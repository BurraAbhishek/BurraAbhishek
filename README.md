## Skills:

### Web Development

I started learning to build websites when I was 14 years old because I wanted to play my childhood video games. Over time, I have learnt to design and develop web applications.

### Mobile App Development

I first came to know about developing mobile applications when I was attending a student developer workshop at university. I wanted to develop my own mobile apps over time. During the coronavirus lockdown, I enrolled in the course on "Introduction to Flutter Development" by @angelabauer of the London App Brewery. That was when I first came to know about Flutter, Dart, Android Studio, Virtualization, Git and GitHub. Over time, I learnt to design and develop beautiful mobile applications.

### Python Programming

The first course which I was taught during my undergraduation was Python programming. Soon, I began to use Python for almost everything. I'm currently learning about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science and Large Scale Data Processing.
