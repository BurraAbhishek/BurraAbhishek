## Skills:

### Web Development 

I started learning to build websites when I was 14 years old because I wanted to play my favourite video games. Over time, I have learnt to design and develop web applications.

### Mobile App Development

I write code for Mobile Apps using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

### Python Programming

The first course which I was taught as an undergraduate was Python programming. Soon, I began to use Python for almost everything. I'm currently learning Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, and Large-Scale Data Processing using Hadoop and MapReduce.

Feeling bored? Want to play a short game? Visit [my Hand Cricket repository](https://github.com/burraabhishek/python-hand-cricket) (This game requires support for Python 3.5+).

### Eating chocolate cakes

Who doesn't love a chocolate cake? We all do. In fact, I love to write code while eating such delicious food! We can eat chocolate cakes and write code together! Want to contact me? Go to the [contact-me](https://github.com/burraabhishek#contact-me) section.
